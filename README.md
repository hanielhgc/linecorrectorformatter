# Line Corrector/Formatter
Program that corrects wrong line breaking due to PDF copy and paste to doc, docx, txt, etc.
Works by informing the path of the txt with the copied text from a PDF file, then it creates a new txt file with the correct line breaking, but notice that it may not correct the line breaking of words starting with upper case.
